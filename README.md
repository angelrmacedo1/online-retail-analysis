# Online Retail Sales Analysis

This project analyzes a UK-based online retail store's transactions to uncover business insights such as top-selling products, monthly revenue trends, and purchasing patterns throughout the day. The full workflow was built using **MySQL** for data cleaning and transformation, and **Tableau** for interactive visualization.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation

Steps were performed on a duplicated table (`transactions_2`) to preserve the raw data. Key tasks:

- **Converted InvoiceDate** from string to proper `DATETIME`
- **Removed Duplicates** using `ROW_NUMBER()` and subqueries
- **Trimmed Text Fields** like Description, StockCode, and Country
- **Removed**:
  - Rows with missing key fields (e.g., InvoiceNo, Quantity)
  - Negative or zero quantities and prices
  - Cancelled transactions (InvoiceNo starting with "C")
- **Added Fields**:
  - `Revenue` = Quantity × UnitPrice
  - `InvoiceYear`, `InvoiceMonth`, `InvoiceDay`
